    <li>"The Sumerians used the abacus almost as early as 3,000 B.C. Used for adding and subtracting, it was just as indispensable for Roman merchants as it was for bookkeepers in the early modern period</li>
      .....
    <li>"During the 17th century, computing machines became masterpieces of precision mechanics. However, they also took some time to develop. This invention by the Swabian mechanician Anton Braun (1686–1728) was only finished by French designer Philipp Vayringe after Braun's death"</li>
 <li>"In 1941 Konrad Zuse built the Z3: the first functional program-controlled automatic computer and the forerunner to the first fully programmable universal computer. However, the Z3 was never used by the public. In 1944 the machine was destroyed during an air raid. </li>
  <li>From as early as 1942 Konrad Zuse was working on its successor, the Z4. In the last days of the war Zuse fled from Berlin with his machine and hid the device in a shed in Hinterstein in the Allgäu region. </li>
   <li>At the end of the 1960s the development of the home computer took a step forward. The Kenbak-1 went on sale for $750 US dollars, but only 50 of these devices were produced in total. Its success was minimal. </li>

     <li>"Flip switches and flashing diodes: named after a star system in Star Trek, the Altair 8800 is still considered a pioneer of personal computers today. Developed in 1975 by John V. Blankenbaker, the device cost 395 dollars and users had to assemble it themselves."</li>
      <li>"A milestone on the path to the PC for the everyday user: the Apple 1. Steve Jobs and Steven Wozniak assembled this was a home computer at home from 1975 to 1976 and tested it in Jobs' parents' garage in Palo Alto, laying the foundations for the most successful company in the world today. The Apple 1 cost $666.66 US dollars at the time, but only 200 devices were sold. They then achieved true worldwide success with the next series: the Apple 2." </li>
       <li>A true product of the '80s, the Commodore 64 made its way into many living rooms and kids' bedrooms where a whole generation grew up with it. The C64 sound chip, the SID (sound interface device), was a sensation at the time, and many musicians programmed their songs on the C64 with real synth sounds. Of course, most other people just used the C64 to play games. </li>
        <li>Konrad Zuse (1910–95) is regarded as a pioneer in the field of computer science, and the creator of the computer. He is said to have built a total of 251 machines over his lifetime. Although many of his devices were never used, their technology was considered groundbreaking for advancing the development of increasingly modern high-performance computers. When asked why he developed programmable machines in the first place, he once said, "I was too lazy to do the math." </li>
         <li>After the construction of the Z2 prototype, Konrad Zuse received 25,000 Reichsmark from the German research institute for aerospace engineering (Deutschen Versuchsanstalt für Luft- und Raumfahrttechnik) to support the development of the Z3. When he was temporarily drafted into the war in 1941 he complained that "while others leave their families behind, I'm leaving the Z3." </li>
